# Research findings — running log

Per execution_plan.md §21.10: observed failure cases, design decisions, and
the runs that motivated each mechanism. This drives later method refinement —
do not design a mechanism the findings below don't call for.

## Phase A findings (2026-09-12 – 2026-09-13)

### F1 — OpenRAL already partially implements mission-invalidity rejection

`_dispatch_execute_rskill` (`reasoner_node.py:4222`) refuses three classes of
proposal before ever sending an action goal: a collective target ("all the
objects"), a second dispatch while one goal is in flight, and a VLA/reward-
model pair that can't co-reside in VRAM. Plan §5.4.5's trustworthiness cases
overlap with these. **Design implication:** `space_runtime`'s admissibility
layer should assume these three are already handled and add only what's
genuinely new — communication/resource/authority conditions — not
re-implement generic proposal sanity checking.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §1.3.

### F2 — Task-completion verification is already reward-gated, not LLM self-report

`evaluate_task_verdict` (`mission.py:156`) consumes `QueryTaskProgress.srv`
(a Robometer reward model's progress/success heads) and only accepts
`complete` above a threshold, routes ambiguous bands to a VLM check, and
bounds retries before `abandon`. **Design implication:** the verification
layer (plan §4.8) should add evidence sources this doesn't cover (has the
right authority been granted; is the executing endpoint still reachable) —
task-completion itself is not an open question to re-solve.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §1.4.

### F3 — WorldState's only resource field is `battery_pct`

Confirmed by reading the schema directly (`schemas.py:3570`), not inferred.
No communication, compute-availability, illumination, or authority field
exists anywhere in it. **Design implication:** `space_context` is additive
ground truth, not an overlay on an existing (if thin) mechanism — there is
nothing partially-there to reconcile with.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §1.5.

### F4 — Safety: build against the C++ kernel, not the Python passthrough

The Python `openral_safety` node is an explicitly-labeled "Day-1... stub"
(its own module docstring) checking only `n_dof` and joint limits. The C++
`openral_safety_kernel` is the shipped, capable one — force/workspace/
controller/collision, fail-closed on stale or unknown link state — and we
confirmed it builds and runs on this fork (registers as
`/openral_safety_kernel`). **Design implication:** never target the Python
passthrough in any experiment; it would understate what the runtime actually
enforces.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §2.

### F5 — WAM has no concrete adapter; do not design an experiment around one

`python/wam/` is a `Protocol` + `NullWorldModel` identity stub only.
**Design implication:** any mental-simulation/failure-anticipation mechanism
in the paper's method must not assume a working WAM exists in this revision.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §2.

### F6 — Insertion point: subclass, don't patch

`_dispatch` is a plain method call (`_handle_tick_result` →
`self._dispatch(...)`), no ROS indirection, no plugin system. A subclass of
`ReasonerNode` overriding only `_dispatch_execute_rskill` inserts mission-
level admissibility with zero upstream source changes; `main()` is 15 lines,
trivially reimplemented to spin the subclass. **Caveat carried forward:**
private method surface, not a public contract — re-verify this seam after
every OpenRAL rebase.
Source: `docs/openral_integration_notes.md` §3.

### F7 — SRB's real control surface is per-action-term topics, not a combined vector

`agent zero`/`agent rand` only *echo* a combined action vector — no
subscriber exists, external control is impossible there. `agent ros` mode
(`RosInterface.setup_action_sub()`) instead creates one typed subscription
per action term: `cmd_vel` (Twist, base), `differential_inverse_kinematics`
(Twist, arm), `binary_joint_position` (Bool, gripper),
`four_wheel_steer` (Float32MultiArray, per-wheel) for `lunar_bot`. Verified a
published Twist actually displaces the robot. **Design implication:** when
Phase B wires an OpenRAL rSkill to drive SRB (via `kind: ros_action`/
`ros_service` wrapping, per `openral_integration_notes.md` §1.3), target
these typed per-term topics — they map far more directly onto rSkill goal
parameters than a raw action vector would.
Source: `docs/srb_integration_notes.md` §3.2–3.3.

### F8 — A ready-made FDIR-relevant signal already exists in SRB

`/srb/env0/reward/penalty_undesired_robot_contacts` is published today,
independent of and prior to any self-collision fix landing. **Design
implication:** worth checking as a verification/FDIR evidence source once
the self-collision work stabilizes, rather than building a new contact
detector from scratch.
Source: `docs/srb_integration_notes.md` §5.

### F9 — This host requires specific environment handling for both stacks

Full detail lives with each stack's own notes, not duplicated here:
OpenRAL — `docs/openral_py310_patch.md` (conda pollution, `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`
for Humble's rosidl). SRB — `docs/srb_integration_notes.md` §2 (`PYTHONPATH`
pollution from the default ROS-Humble shell sourcing; `ISAAC_SIM_PATH` unset).
**Design implication:** any run-manifest/reproducibility tooling (plan §19)
must capture these env-var/PATH conditions explicitly, not just git
revisions — a clean checkout on this machine still needs them to run at all.

### F10 — Process hygiene on a shared multi-agent host

A `pkill -f` pattern-match on this session's own process killed another
agent's unrelated long-running processes. **Design implication:** any tooling
this project builds that manages simulator/agent processes (experiment
runner, §12) must address processes by exact PID it recorded at launch time,
never by command-line pattern matching.
Source: `docs/srb_integration_notes.md` §4.

## Phase B findings (2026-09-13)

### F11 — No existing rSkill kind fit a scripted, non-learned test motion ✅ resolved

`rskill_runner_node.make_default_skill_resolver` only handled
`kind: "vla"` / `"ros_action"` / `"ros_service"` (`"wam"` raises
"not implemented"). `kind: "playbook"` exists (`rskills/preflight-reach`) but
is an S2 *decision procedure* the reasoner composes — it never emits an
`Action` chunk itself; confirmed `"vla"` requires `model_family` +
`weights_uri` and routes through `openral_sim.factory.make_policy` (a real
policy-adapter factory, not a lightweight generic loader). **Resolved**:
added `kind: "procedural"` to `RSkillManifest`/`RSkillKind`, a
`ProceduralIntegration` manifest block, and a resolver branch — a
deterministic, non-learned actuating skill with no weights and no external
ROS server, needed anyway for execution_plan.md §5.2's Baseline A
(procedure-driven mission execution). Verified live: `ros2 action send_goal`
against the real `ExecuteRskill` action server dispatched
`ProceduralBodyTwistRskill`, which drove `lunar_bot`'s base through the full
candidate_action → kernel → safe_action → HAL → SRB path and moved the robot.
Source: `docs/phase_b_procedural_kind.md`.

### F12 — The shipped C++ kernel's BODY_TWIST bound is uncharacterized

`robots/<id>/robot.yaml`'s `SafetyEnvelope.max_base_linear_speed_m_s` /
`max_base_angular_speed_rad_s` exist at the Pydantic/manifest level, but a
repo-wide grep of the kernel's C++ source finds no code consuming them —
only comments mentioning BODY_TWIST. The kernel did not reject a live 6-wide
BODY_TWIST chunk against lunar_bot's 21-dof-declared envelope in the F11
test, so *something* passed it through, but what (if anything) actually
bounds a BODY_TWIST chunk's magnitude today is unconfirmed. **Design
implication:** do not treat a robot.yaml's base-speed bounds as enforced
until this is characterized directly (deliberately exceed the declared bound
and confirm a rejection) — an unverified safety bound is a false-confidence
risk, not a minor gap.
Source: `docs/phase_b_lunar_bot_hal.md`.

### F13 — The safety kernel takes its envelope as flat ROS parameters, not a manifest path

Unlike the HAL lifecycle nodes (`robot_yaml` + `hal_mode` params, resolved
via `build_hal`), the C++ safety kernel reads flattened scalar/array ROS
parameters (`n_dof`, `joint_position_min/max`, `joint_velocity_max`,
`joint_torque_max`, `max_ee_speed_m_s`, ...) — it does not parse
`robots/<id>/robot.yaml` itself. The sanctioned way to produce these is
`openral_safety.envelope_loader.compute_intersection(robot, skill)` +
`kernel_params_from_envelope(...)`, normally invoked by
`deploy_e2e.launch.py`. **Design implication:** any bring-up/experiment
tooling that starts the kernel standalone (outside that launch file) must
call this loader itself rather than hand-constructing parameters — guessing
them wastes time and produces misleading "envelope load failed" errors that
name the wrong missing field.
Source: `docs/phase_b_lunar_bot_hal.md`.

### F14 — `ros2 lifecycle`/`node list` don't enumerate nodes by name on this host

Same symptom seen with SRB's own ROS bridge in A3/A4: a node is alive, its
services and topics work, but `ros2 node list` / `ros2 lifecycle set/get`
report "Node not found" or nothing at all. Calling the
`lifecycle_msgs/srv/ChangeState` / `GetState` services directly by their
fully-qualified service name works every time. **Design implication:** any
bring-up script this project writes should drive lifecycle nodes via direct
service calls, not the `ros2 lifecycle` CLI, on this host.
Source: `docs/phase_b_lunar_bot_hal.md`.

### F15 — RESOLVED: the safety kernel's heartbeat is fine; the abort was a one-off DDS hiccup, not a design gap

Originally recorded as "the kernel doesn't re-publish `/openral/safety_status`
on a heartbeat." **That was wrong — corrected after checking properly.**
`publish_diagnostics()` (bound to the kernel's 1-second `create_wall_timer`,
the same one driving `/diagnostics`) ends with an *unconditional*
`publish_safety_status_now()` call, in-code documented as "ADR-0096 /
HZ-0096-1 mitigation 2 — refresh the latched status at the same 1 Hz cadence
so `header.stamp` is standing evidence the publisher is alive." Re-verified
live: kernel alone, configured + activated, `ros2 topic hz` on both
`/diagnostics` and `/openral/safety_status` measured a clean, exact **1.000
Hz** on each. The original "zero messages in 5s" reading was a shell-tooling
artifact — piping `timeout N ros2 topic hz ... | tail` loses buffered output
when `timeout` SIGTERMs the process mid-print; redirecting to a file instead
showed the real numbers immediately.

`rskill_runner_node.py`'s `_SAFETY_STATUS_LIVENESS_S = 3.0` staleness check
is real and does exist, but the mechanism it watches is sound. The one abort
we saw (a 3s `ExecuteRskill` dispatch, aborted at ~2.7s, "last update 3.0s
ago") is best explained as a single missed or delayed heartbeat delivery
under a busier multi-participant DDS graph (SRB + kernel + HAL + runner all
live at once) at the exact instant the runner happened to check — not a
structural gap. The mechanism is deliberately conservative by design ("fail
toward assume-unsafe... can only ADD an abort, never suppress one"), so an
occasional trip under load is the mechanism doing its documented job, not a
bug to eliminate.

**Design implication:** do not spend more effort "fixing" this. Treat an
occasional safety-stale abort as expected system behavior a real mission
must be robust to — which is, usefully, exactly the kind of event
execution_plan.md §5.4.4 (fault/degradation) and §13.6 (failure/recovery
campaign) already want to study, not a nuisance orthogonal to the research.
Recovery-after-anomaly and continued-execution-after-fault are metrics in
the plan (§5.5) — this is a live instance of the exact class of event they
measure.
